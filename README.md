# Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithm that incrementally builds solutions by exploring all possible options, one step at a time. If an option turns out to be invalid or doesn't lead to a solution, the algorithm "backtracks" by undoing the last step and tries another option. This process continues until all possible options are explored or a solution is found.

## Key Points:

Recursive Exploration: The algorithm tries every possible path recursively.

Backtracking: When a path doesnâ€™t lead to a solution, the algorithm goes back to the previous decision point (backtracks) and tries a different path.

Efficient Exploration: By eliminating invalid paths early, the algorithm avoids unnecessary exploration of incorrect solutions.

Example: Subset Generation

In the context of generating all subsets of a set, the backtracking algorithm works by:

Starting with an empty subset.

Adding an element to the current subset and recursively exploring all subsets that include that element.

Backtracking by removing the last added element and exploring subsets that exclude that element.
